# tfidf-text-processing
A small NLP pipeline that preprocesses text and computes TF-IDF scores from scratch
# TF-IDF Text Processing

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end text processing pipeline in Python and computes TF-IDF scores to identify important words in documents.

The goal is to demonstrate foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and algorithmic thinking.
